#Development/Design Fund Program
===========

###Qualified Design Consultants
The Development/Design Fund awards grants to community-based organizations that
pay for architectural, landscape and urban design, as well as neighborhood 
planning services. Grant awardees are limited to hiring firms that have been 
pre-qualified by the Community Design Center Rochester (CDCR) and must not 
select a design professional that is not on this list. Typically, with every 
Development/Design Fund grant the CDCR will provide a “short-list” of 
recommended design firms to the grant awardee, who is responsible for issuing a
Request for Proposal (RFP) to the short-listed firms.<br />

To become pre-qualified, professional design firms must respond to the 
Development/Design Fund’s Request for Qualifications (RFQ). The RFQ is issued 
to as many firms as possible throughout the greater Rochester region. The CDCR 
may accept firm qualifications throughout the year on a case by case basis 
determined by levels of program funding and number of currently participating 
firms. We encourage firms of all sizes and specializations to apply for 
pre-qualification. To inquire about pre-qualifying a firm, contact Sebastian 
Baliva at design@rrcdc.org or 585.271.0520.<br />

CDCR would like to acknowledge and personally thank our current list of 
pre-qualified design firms and consultants. They are an asset to this program 
and their work to build upon the framework of Rochester’s neighborhoods will 
enhance the success of communities and our city for years to come.  Thank you
