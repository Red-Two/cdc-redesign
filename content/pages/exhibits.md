# Exhibits

The Design Gallery hosts exhibits that display the work of urban designers, architects, landscape architects, planners, students, artists, craftsmen and other design professionals who enhance our communities.
Themed exhibitions highlight aspects of communities that benefit from creative rethinking of the built environment and the spaces shared by the public.

Now on Display: Connecting Spaces


The Community Design Center Rochester in conjunction with the annual
award-winning Reshaping Rochester lecture series, presents "Connecting
Spaces/ Connecting Places"an exhibition about corridors and the role that
they play in revitalization and connectivity in neighborhoods and their
metropolitan areas.

This exhibition is a collaborative venture highlighting projects associated
with this year's guest speakers and are located in states that include
Colorado, Minnesota, Michigan, Virginia, Georgia, Connecticut and New York.
These have been transformative efforts that have changed places and had a
positive impact on city streets, elevated walkways, riverfronts and bridges
creatively connecting communities.

_This exhibit is on display through June 2015._
