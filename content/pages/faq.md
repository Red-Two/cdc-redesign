## Frequently Asked Questions
### What is the Development/Design Fund?
The Development/Design Fund is a grant and technical assistance program that 
aids community-based organizations to effectively hire and work with design 
consultants.<br /> 

### How much can we request? 
You can request up to $15,000 for pre-development funding. Grants amounts will 
vary with the size and scope of each individual project. It may be possible 
that your organization is awarded a grant that is less than what you have 
requested. This will be decided by the Development/Design Fund Committee based 
on your requested funding and your projects size and scope.<br /> 

### What is a Recoverable Grant? 
If your project is determined feasible and moves ahead to construction, the 
Development/Design funds are to be repaid (without interest) from construction 
financing sources. As part of the project agreement your organization will 
agree to include the pre-development funding into the budget for the 
construction and return it to the CDCR. This enables the CDCR to re-use the 
funds to support other vital community projects.<br />

The advantage of the Development/Design Fund is that it will better equip 
groups to acquire support, construction financing and have a well thought out 
direction for project. Additionally, if your project proves to be unfeasible, 
the funding can be forgiven as a grant, saving you from investing time and 
money into a project that will likely not be successful.<br />

### Can anyone apply for a grant to help my community? 
No, we only offer grants to community-based organizations that are registered 
501c3 non-profits. In the event that your organization is not a 501c3 or you 
are a private property owner, we encourage you to partner with a local 501c3 
organization. Certain situations may allow for a non-501c3 organization (ex. 
501c6, business association) to apply for a grant provided that you have a 
501c3 sponsor your organization as a fiduciary.<br />
