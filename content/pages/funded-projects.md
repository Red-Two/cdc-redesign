===============

The Community Design Center Rochester is pleased to announce the award winners 
from the Development / Design Fund Fall 2014 grant cycle. This cycle’s winners 
are the <b>Beechwood Neighbors Greenhouse Collaborative</b> and the <b>Ibero - 
American Development Corporation.</b>  Congratulations!<br /> 

### Beechwood Neighbors Greenhouse Collaborative (BNGC)
This project, initiated by local parents and community members, focuses on 
increasing accessibility to healthy/locally grown food to an area of the city 
that has been identified as a “food swamp.” Building upon an existing network 
of food access and education, the project site will become another hub for 
healthy food access and fostering social connections. The award will be used to
design a conceptual site plan and programming for the property located at 359 
Webster Avenue, behind the Freedom Market. In addition to improving the 
neighborhood’s health, long term goals include strengthening relationships 
across the community.<br />

### Ibero - American Development Corporation (IADC)
The IADC was seeking predevelopment funding for architectural and planning
services that would help to prioritize the development of two sites within the
El Camino area. This award will support phase 1 of this project which will
explore the feasibility and site selection of two locations that might be
transformed into a new community space. Working extensively with residents,
they collectively view developing a sustainable community site as the next step
in neighborhood progress. The eventual building rehabilitation will not only
improve the aesthetics of the neighborhood but also provide a place that
supports community activities and events.<br />
