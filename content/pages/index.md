# Our Mission
============

The Community Design Center of Rochester (CDCR) is a non-profit organization of
design professionals promoting healthy, sustainable communities by encouraging
quality design of the built environment and thoughtful use of built and natural
resources. We do this by providing technical assistance and access to
educational and training opportunities that increase awareness about the built
environment, the impact of design and the importance of good urban planning.
By actively engaging through partnerships in city and regional initiatives
that include guiding communities in creating vision plans and encouraging
community involvement in planning and developing processes, CDCR plays a
critical role as an advocate for good design in the Greater Rochester Region.
