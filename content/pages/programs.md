# Develpment/Design Fund Program

__About the Program__<br />
The Community Design Center Rochester (CDCR) advocates for the value of good 
design, planning and public policy to support more livable and sustainable 
communities in the Rochester region. Though the Development/Design Fund 
program we provide funding and technical assistance to help community-based 
organizations hire and work with architectural and planning consultants at the 
early stages of community revitalization projects. The purpose of the 
Development/Design Fund is to improve the quality of revitalization efforts in 
challenged areas of our city.<br />

The Development/Design Fund is generously funded by the Louis S. and Molly B. 
Wolk Foundation, the Max and Marion Farash Charitable Foundation, and the New 
York State Council on the Arts. The program aids 501c3 non-profit organizations
by awarding grants and providing technical assistance. Grant awards that range 
from $2,500 to $15,000. These grants support a wide range of projects, and 
maintain an emphasis on implementation of existing plans and projects that 
have already gained some community participation. However, it also supports new
planning initiatives where needed.<br />

The Development/Design Fund supports planning, design and early-action funding 
for projects that need professional consultants (architects, landscape 
architects, planners, environmental engineers), to perform pre-development 
work such as conceptual architectural drawings, community planning, urban 
design, and market analyses. Project types might include: buildings and 
sites, neighborhood planning, blight remediation, greening and sustainability
initiatives, streetscapes, landscape design, development of design 
guidelines, and the like.<br />

We encourage you to approach us with an idea for development and we will follow
up with you to help guide the process; we are here to be of assistance. Grant 
applications are reviewed twice yearly in both the spring and the fall through 
a competitive application process. CDCR staff assists with developing a scope 
of work and a Request for Proposals (RFP), interviewing and selecting a 
consultant, and working with that consultant throughout the life of your 
project. Once you receive a grant, the CDCR Development/Design Fund Committee 
is also available to provide design review and general insight into your 
project.<br /> 

When a project involves specific real estate development, as opposed to 
community planning, assistance is typically provided as a “recoverable grant.” 
If your project moves ahead to construction, the Development/Design Fund grant 
is to be repaid (without interest) from construction financing sources. This 
enables the CDCR to re-use the funds to support other vital community projects.
If the project proves to be unfeasible, the funding can be forgiven.<br />
