# Reshaping Rochester Series


Our annual lecture series features a blue-ribbon roster of innovative thinkers,
practitioners and leaders who come to Rochester to share their ideas and
experience with us. 

Reshaping Rochester focuses on the efforts, strategies and successes
accomplished by cities that face similar challenges to ours: downtown
revitalization, preserving the character of our neighborhoods and communities,
creating mixed-use centers and walkable commercial districts, and enlisting
community involvement. 




## Upcoming Events




### "New Currents in a River City"

__Mayor Christopher Coleman__ took office as Saint Paul's Mayor in 2005 after
several years as a city councilmember and community and neighborhood leader. He
immediately set forth initiatives to make Saint Paul the most livable city in
America. His priorities include working to close the achievement gap, creating
sustainable and responsible budgets, and investing in the infrastructure of
Saint Paul. He has achieved several of his goals, advocating for education and
public safety, and being instrumental in championing the Green Line (Central
Corridor Light Rail line)the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken in
the state of Minnesota.

Mayor Coleman is past President of the National League of Cities, a national
organization of city leaders across the United States. In 2012, he was elected
as the Second Vice President of National League of Cities, and became the
League's Vice President in 2013. 

Under Mayor Coleman's terms, Saint Paul's downtown has seen revitalization. As
light rail ridership continues to increase and more restaurants and
entertainment venues have moved in, demand for housing has increased
exponentially and downtown's vibrant culture has grown. Saint Paul has also
become a national leader in green initiatives and sustainable living. The
city's sustainable investments include retrofitting buildings for energy
efficiency, equipping public places with solar panels and electric vehicle
charging stations, and more.
